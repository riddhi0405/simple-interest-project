This project is a simple and beginner-friendly implementation of a Simple Interest Calculator using a shell script (simple-interest.sh). The script takes Principal amount, Rate of Interest, and Time period as inputs from the user and calculates the simple interest based on the standard formula:

Simple Interest
=
𝑃

𝑅

𝑇

Simple Interest=

The goal of this project is to practice Linux shell scripting, working with basic arithmetic operations, and to demonstrate good software development practices by including important project files such as a LICENSE, README.md, CODE_OF_CONDUCT, and CONTRIBUTING.md.
